# AI Usage in Development

This document outlines how AI was strategically used throughout the development process to accelerate development while maintaining code quality.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Strategy

### Time Allocation

- **Total Development Time:** ~4.5 hours
- **AI Usage:** Throughout the process
- **Manual Review:** AI-generated code was reviewed and validated

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling Setup (AI-Generated)

### Database & ORM Setup

- **Drizzle ORM configuration** - AI handled the initial setup and configuration
- **Database schema design assist** - I used ChatGPT Voice to talk through the spec and the ideas I had
- **Migration generation** - Automated migration file creation

### State Management

- **React Query setup** - AI configured the query client and providers
- **Custom hooks** - AI generated reusable data fetching hooks for RQ

### UI Framework

- **Shadcn/ui integration** - I installed the base repo, alongside the starter components, I then allowed AI to use these to prototype layouts

## üìù Code Generation Patterns

### API Development

1. **Initial Pattern Definition:** Manually created `api.users.ts` as a template
2. **Pattern Replication:** AI generated similar patterns for:
   - `api.chats.ts`
   - `api.messages.ts`
   - `api.bookings.ts`
   - `api.ai.ts`

### Database Actions

- **CRUD Operations:** AI generated database action functions following established patterns
- **Type Safety:** AI maintained TypeScript types throughout
- **Error Handling:** AI implemented consistent error handling patterns

## üß† AI Integration Features

### Knowledge Base Creation

AI was used to create a example knowledge base covering:

- University tuition fees and payment options
- Scholarship and financial aid information
- Academic program details
- Campus services and resources
- Admission requirements and processes

**Example Knowledge Base Entries:**

```typescript
// Sample knowledge base content
{
  topic: "tuition_fees",
  content: "Undergraduate tuition for the 2024-2025 academic year is $15,000 per semester..."
},
{
  topic: "scholarships",
  content: "Merit-based scholarships are available for students with GPA above 3.5..."
}
```

### Letting AI help me talk to AI

AI was used to create the prompts for:

- **Chat responses** - Natural, helpful AI responses
- **Escalation detection** - Identifying when human intervention is needed
- **Title generation** - Creating meaningful chat titles
- **Context awareness** - Maintaining conversation context

## üîç Quality Assurance

### Code Review Process

Every AI-generated piece of code underwent manual review, alongside testing functionality.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** I defined test scenarios and then allowed AI to write the rest
- **E2E Tests:** I wrote down specific scenarios I wanted to test, including the components and desired outcomes/failures
- **Test Data:** AI generated realistic test data and fixtures

## üö® Challenges & Mitigation

### Code Quality Concerns

**Challenge:** AI sometimes generates code that needs refinement
**Mitigation:**

- Reviewing every new line, not just accepting blocks of new code
- Manual testing of all AI-generated features
- Iterative refinement based on testing results
